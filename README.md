This project demonstrates how to retrieve data from a REST API and display it in a RecyclerView within an Android application using Kotlin. The following steps outline the process:

    Create Project and Add Dependencies
        Begin by creating a new Android project.
        Add the necessary dependencies for Retrofit, RecyclerView, and Glide in the build.gradle file to ensure you have the libraries needed for API interactions, UI components, and image loading.

    Define Kotlin Data Class
        Define a Kotlin data class that represents the user object. This class is based on the JSON structure provided by the API, allowing you to map the API response to Kotlin objects.

    Define Retrofit Interface
        Create a Retrofit interface to specify the API endpoint for fetching user data. This interface will include methods for making network requests and retrieving the necessary information.

    Setup Retrofit Instance
        Set up a singleton object for Retrofit, including the base URL of the API and the necessary converter factory for JSON parsing. This instance will manage network operations and data parsing.

    Create RecyclerView Adapter
        Implement a RecyclerView Adapter and ViewHolder. This component will bind the user data to the views in the RecyclerView, displaying details such as the user's name, company, and photo.

    Create XML Layouts
        Design the XML layout files for the RecyclerView and the individual user items. Ensure that the user item layout includes views for displaying the userâ€™s photo, name, and company.
